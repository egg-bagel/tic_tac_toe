# tic_tac_toe
Tic tac toe project from TOP Ruby course

I am building a tic-tac-toe game for two human players. It is played on the command line.
The board is displayed between turns.

TBH I had no idea how to begin this project (first time making something with OOP)
so my strategy was to look at the example code linked by TOP and copy it while analyzing it.
So this code is not my original work, it comes from https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Ruby. 
I've added lots of comments breaking down what each piece of code does and how the pieces work
together. My objective doing this is to get a better understanding of how to approach future projects 
like this using OOP.
